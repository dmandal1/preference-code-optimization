Implement Notification Mute Functionality for Merchandising Teams

Description:

Backend:

Save Activity:

Before creating any notification, check if the user has enabled notifications for the product merchandising team.

If notifications are disabled, skip the notification creation process.

This affects the saveActivity method in /Users/jainsh/git/project/PCP/p3d-notification-service/src/server/service/activity.service.ts.

Implement a function isNotificationEnabled(user_id, merch_id) to check if notifications are enabled for the given merchandising team. This function will retrieve data from the preference table for the specified user ID.

Call this function around lines 231 and 484 for reference.
